# ![AudioConnect](http://i.imgur.com/IdmU2cS.png)

A [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/about-spigot/) Minecraft server plugin that provides a powerful web-based audio engine to integrate real-time game audio that is dynamic around player location or actions.

Use AudioConnect to provide truly unique and immersive gameplay with music, sound-effects, soundscapes, voice-over, or any other kind of audio.
You can control where and when the audio plays in-game using its [WorldGuard](https://github.com/sk89q/WorldGuard) region integration.

This plugin is intended to operate as a client to the [minecraftaudio.com](https://minecraftaudio.com) web service, but it can be configured to connect with any web server that follows the protocol.

AudioConnect is open source and is available under The MIT License (MIT)
